  <h2>Business Mission</h2>
  <p>
    At Clarisse's café, coffee is more than a drink—it's a ritual. In a world that rushes, we offer a place that lingers. Thoughtfully brewed, quietly luxurious, and rooted in simplicity, our café is a haven for those who value presence over pace. <br /> <br />

We source with care, serve with grace, and design each moment to feel effortless yet refined. Whether it’s the delicate aroma of a hand-poured brew or the gentle hum of calm conversation, everything here is intentional. <br /> <br />

Unfold your morning. Refine your rhythm. Find your pause with us.
